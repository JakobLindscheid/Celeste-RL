src folder contains multiple algorithms utils is for extra necessary functionality.
The only file that is important to run is:

#### program.py 

which can be run with parameter -alg or --algorithm

the possible values are:
##### ppo
##### td3
##### sac
##### dqn
##### Astar
##### A2C

for the 6 different algorithms. Sac cannot be run that is just the baseline from the codebase we used.
This is not included in the submission but is on the github repository.
